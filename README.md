Lauro Figueiredo, 23 years old web generalist from Brazil.

I'm a self-taught programmer that has been working professionally with web technologies for 4 years. One of many that learned HTML & CSS from Neopets and Blogger back in 00's.

You might know me for the guy with the cool Zoom backgrouds, the guy that mentions he uses Linux anytime he can, the dad jokes guy or the guy with the musical instrument addiction.

Kind-of-sociable introvert. Aspiring musician and singer with a long way to go. Avid Dungeons & Dragons player and newborn Dungeon Master. Luna's father, the beautiful black mutt on my profile picture and best pupperino. Finishing my BS in Archaeology (yeah, I know).
