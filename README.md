Lauro Figueiredo, 26 years old web generalist from Brazil.

I'm a self-taught programmer that has been working professionally with web technologies for 6 years. One of many that learned HTML & CSS from Neopets and Blogger back in the 00's.

Kind-of-sociable introvert. Aspiring musician and singer with a long way to go. Avid Dungeons & Dragons player and newborn Dungeon Master. Archaeologist (yes, I know). In constant state of always waiting for the next Pok√©mon and The Legend of Zelda games.
